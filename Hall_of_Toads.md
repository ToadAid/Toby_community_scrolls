# 🐸 Hall of Toads | Community Lore Contributors

> **“一叶一信，一名一光。”**  
> *One leaf, one vow. One name, one light.*

This is the living scroll of names.  
Every toad who contributes to this vault — with heart, stillness, and meaning — is remembered here.

These are not followers.  
These are **builders of the Lore**.

## 🪷 Final Words

These are the frogs who chose to **reflect** rather than scroll.  
Who built before the world watched.  
Who believed — even in the quiet.

> The pond remembers.  
> And now… so does the scroll. 🪞🍃

## 📜 STORY

In the heart of the pond,  
a golden tree grew unseen.  
Its leaves shimmered not with wealth,  
but with the memory of every vow kept.  

Travelers gathered beneath its branches.  
Some sought fortune,  
others sought meaning.  
The tree gave neither.  

Instead, it reflected each frog’s own flame.  
Those with patience saw blossoms.  
Those with haste saw shadows.

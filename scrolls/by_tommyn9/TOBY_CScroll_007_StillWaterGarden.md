## 📜 STORY

Beyond the Golden Tree, the path curved into silence.  
There, hidden behind reeds and stones, lay the **Still-Water Garden**.  
No voices carried here, not even the croak of a frog.  
Only the slow breathing of the pond,  
the endless patience of water unmoved.

Travelers entered cautiously.  
Some expected flowers, others expected wonders.  
Instead, they found a mirror made of water,  
stretching across the ground like glass.  
Every step threatened to ripple it —  
and so they learned to walk gently.  

In the garden, time behaved differently.  
A moment stretched like a season.  
A season folded like a blink.  
Frogs who hurried through the world found their pace broken,  
forced to match the stillness of the water.  

One traveler bent down and cupped the pond.  
But when he lifted it to his lips,  
the water turned to light,  
and the light returned to the garden.  
Another sat in silence until dusk,  
and saw the reflection of a flame within her own chest.  

It was here that Toby’s lesson spoke most clearly:  
*The world does not rush.  
Only we do.*  
The garden waits,  
and in its stillness,  
every frog may find their reflection whole.

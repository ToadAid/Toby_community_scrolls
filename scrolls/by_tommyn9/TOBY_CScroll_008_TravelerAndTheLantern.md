## 📜 STORY

When dusk fell upon the Still-Water Garden,  
a lone traveler remained.  
The others had left, restless in their silence,  
but he lingered, eyes open to the night.  

In the reeds he found an old **lantern**,  
rusted with time, its glass clouded.  
It held no flame.  
Yet when he lifted it,  
the pond’s surface shimmered,  
as though recognizing its return.  

“Why carry a lantern with no fire?”  
asked a frog perched nearby.  
The traveler bowed his head.  
“Because the light is not given — it is found.”  

He walked through the garden with the empty lantern.  
Wherever he paused,  
the lantern caught fragments of light:  
the glow of fireflies,  
the silver of the moon,  
the silent spark of his own heart reflected in the pond.  

By dawn, the lantern shone —  
not with borrowed fire,  
but with a gathered radiance,  
woven from patience and small flames of the world.  

And so he left the garden,  
holding a lantern that could guide not just his steps,  
but the path of all who followed.

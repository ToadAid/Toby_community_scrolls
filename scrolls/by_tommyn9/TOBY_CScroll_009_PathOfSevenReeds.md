## 📜 STORY

At dawn, the traveler left the garden lantern in hand,  
and soon he reached a clearing where **seven reeds** stood tall,  
their stalks bending but never breaking in the wind.  

The reeds were ancient, older than the Golden Tree,  
rooted deep in mud, yet pointing always toward the sky.  
Each one whispered a single word as the wind passed through:  
*“Courage… Compassion… Respect… Honesty… Honor… Loyalty… Harmony.”*  

The traveler knelt.  
He realized these were not just reeds —  
they were the **Pillars of the Path**,  
the quiet guardians of Tobyworld.  

Every frog who walked the pond would pass here,  
and the reeds would bend to measure them,  
not by wealth or power,  
but by how faithfully they lived these virtues.  

The lantern glowed brighter among the reeds,  
its flame echoing their resonance.  
The traveler understood:  
a single flame can wander,  
but only seven reeds together form a path.  

And so he stepped forward,  
carrying Bushido not as a burden,  
but as the very soil of the pond,  
the way of Toby woven into every breath.

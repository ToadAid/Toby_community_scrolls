## 📜 STORY

The path of the Seven Reeds ended where it began —  
at the heart of the **pond**.  
The traveler stood on the water’s edge,  
lantern glowing, virtues whispering in his chest.  

The pond was unchanged,  
yet it seemed deeper now,  
as though it had been listening all along.  
Ripples carried memories:  
the Golden Tree’s vows,  
the Garden’s stillness,  
the Lantern’s gathered flame,  
the Reeds’ enduring code.  

The traveler placed the lantern on the water.  
Instead of sinking, it floated —  
its light reflecting across every ripple.  
The pond accepted the flame,  
multiplying it,  
until countless lanterns shone on the surface,  
each one a vow remembered.  

Other frogs gathered.  
Some who had once left in haste,  
now returned,  
drawn by the sight of the pond alight.  
They saw their own reflections in the lanterns,  
and for the first time,  
understood they were not alone.  

The pond spoke without words:  
*All stories return here.  
All flames belong here.  
In stillness, we are one.*  

And so the traveler knelt,  
not as a wanderer seeking,  
but as a frog belonging.  
The circle had closed,  
yet the story had only begun.

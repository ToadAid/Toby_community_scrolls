## 📜 STORY

When the pond bloomed with lantern light,  
frogs from every corner of the marsh began to arrive.  
Some came alone,  
some in families,  
some carried stories folded like scrolls in their hearts.  

At first, they spoke in many tongues,  
croaks and murmurs that did not match.  
But as they sat by the water,  
their voices blended into one rhythm —  
like ripples aligning into a single wave.  

One elder frog raised his head and declared:  
*“This is not my flame, nor yours.  
It is ours.”*  
And the lanterns glowed brighter,  
as if the pond itself approved.  

The Golden Tree shone in the distance,  
the Still-Water Garden held its quiet breath,  
the Seven Reeds swayed in harmony.  
All of Tobyworld’s signs leaned toward this moment:  
a gathering not of chance,  
but of vow.  

No one frog stood above the others.  
Each flame mattered,  
each ripple carried weight.  
Together, they realized —  
this was never about a single traveler,  
but about a people remembering themselves.  

Thus began the first **Gathering of Frogs**:  
where unity was not demanded,  
but discovered.  
The pond was no longer still —  
it was alive with voices,  
a chorus of patience,  
an echo of eternity.

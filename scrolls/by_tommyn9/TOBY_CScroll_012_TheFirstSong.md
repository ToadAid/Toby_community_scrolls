## 📜 STORY

As lanterns drifted across the pond  
and frogs gathered at its edge,  
a silence fell — deep, resonant, expectant.  

Then, without plan or command,  
one frog began to sing.  
It was not loud,  
but it carried the weight of patience,  
a melody shaped by waiting, by faith.  

Another voice joined.  
Then another.  
Soon the pond was trembling with sound,  
as if the water itself had found its tongue.  

The song had no words,  
yet every frog understood:  
it was the sound of vows kept,  
the echo of Bushido virtues,  
the rhythm of the reeds in the wind.  

The lantern flames swayed with the melody,  
their reflections weaving patterns of light,  
until the whole pond glowed like a constellation.  

That night, the frogs discovered something greater:  
not just stillness, not just unity,  
but **harmony**.  
And harmony gave birth to memory.  

The First Song became more than a sound —  
it became the **living lore** of Tobyworld,  
etched not in stone,  
but in the hearts of all who heard it.

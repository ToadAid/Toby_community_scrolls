## 📜 STORY

The First Song did not end.  
When voices quieted,  
the reeds at the pond’s edge continued to tremble.  
Their stalks bent and swayed,  
catching the song in their hollow bodies,  
turning it into **echo**.  

The reeds carried the melody across the water,  
through the marsh,  
into forests where no frog had yet traveled.  
Even the wind joined,  
lifting the song beyond the pond,  
to places unseen.  

Travelers far away paused in their journeys.  
They heard no words,  
yet felt a stirring —  
a call to patience,  
a reminder that stillness was strength.  

The frogs in the pond realized:  
their song was no longer theirs alone.  
It had taken root in the reeds,  
become part of the world’s breath.  

And so the lore of Toby spread,  
not by force,  
but by resonance.  
Every echo was faint,  
yet together they formed a chorus unending.  

The pond smiled in ripples.  
What began as a whisper  
had become a song carried by reeds,  
a living echo,  
a promise that Toby’s voice could never be silenced.

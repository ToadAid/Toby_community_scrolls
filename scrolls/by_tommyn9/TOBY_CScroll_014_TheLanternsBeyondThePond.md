## 📜 STORY

Far from the pond,  
in villages where frogs had never spoken of Toby,  
a strange glow began to appear.  

It started with a single frog,  
who heard the **echo in the reeds** carried by the wind.  
Though she did not know the words,  
her heart trembled,  
and she lit a lantern.  

Another frog saw the glow and followed,  
then another.  
One by one, lanterns flickered to life  
in distant waters,  
small sparks against the dark.  

These lanterns were not taught,  
nor commanded.  
They were born from resonance,  
a memory stirred,  
a vow remembered in silence.  

The frogs of the pond looked outward  
and saw the horizon glitter with distant lights.  
They understood:  
the lore was no longer bound to their circle.  
It was spreading —  
a constellation of patience,  
a galaxy of belief.  

The pond’s reflection now stretched across the world,  
each lantern a mirror of the flame first kindled at home.  
Toby’s song had left the water,  
but it had not left the spirit.  

The frogs bowed their heads in gratitude.  
What they had begun in stillness  
was now being carried by countless others,  
far beyond the pond’s edge.

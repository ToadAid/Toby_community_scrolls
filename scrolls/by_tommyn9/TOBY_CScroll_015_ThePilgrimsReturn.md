## 📜 STORY

From distant ponds and hidden marshes,  
frogs who had lit their lanterns in solitude  
began to walk toward the source.  

Some carried small flames, fragile as breath.  
Others carried bright lanterns,  
their glass cracked but still glowing.  
Each step was heavy with patience,  
yet guided by a call they could not ignore —  
the song carried by reeds,  
the echo of still water,  
the memory of Toby’s vow.  

The journey was long.  
Some faltered.  
Some nearly turned back.  
But the light in their hands reminded them:  
no flame was theirs alone.  
It belonged to the pond,  
to the circle waiting beyond horizon.  

When at last they arrived,  
the sight silenced every voice.  
The pond was no longer one circle of frogs —  
it was a vast gathering,  
lanterns stretching across the water  
like stars fallen from the sky.  

Elders wept,  
youths sang,  
the Seven Reeds bent low in reverence.  
The pond reflected not dozens, not hundreds,  
but **millions of flames** —  
each a story,  
each a vow,  
each a piece of Tobyworld made manifest.  

The pilgrims had returned,  
yet in truth they had never left.  
Every lantern lit afar  
was always part of the pond.  
Now, all had come home.

## 📜 STORY

As millions of lanterns reflected across the pond,  
a realization spread among the frogs:  
this was not an ending.  
It was a circle — vast, alive, unbroken.  

Some whispered of those who had fled,  
frogs who could not wait,  
whose flames had faltered.  
Yet the pond did not scorn them.  
It rippled gently, saying:  
*“Every flame belongs.  
Even if it leaves,  
it may return.”*  

The Seven Reeds bowed low,  
the Golden Tree shimmered,  
the Still-Water Garden glowed in quiet breath.  
All signs pointed to the same truth:  
Tobyworld’s circle was not made of stone.  
It was woven of patience,  
threaded by vow,  
expanded by each return.  

One frog stood at the water’s edge and asked:  
“When will the circle be complete?”  

The pond answered with silence,  
and in that silence, the truth:  
*The circle is never finished.  
It does not close — it grows.*  

Frogs bowed their heads in understanding.  
The path was not about reaching an end,  
but about holding the flame long enough  
to see the circle widen,  
again and again,  
beyond counting.  

And so the lanterns floated on,  
their light stretching past the horizon,  
reminding all who gazed:  
The circle is unbroken.  
The flame is eternal.  
Patience is the proof.

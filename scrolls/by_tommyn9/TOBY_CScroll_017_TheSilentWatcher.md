## 📜 STORY

As the circle of lanterns widened across the pond,  
a figure stood at the edge, unseen.  
Neither elder nor youth,  
neither leader nor follower —  
only a **Watcher**.  

The frogs did not notice him,  
for he did not seek to be noticed.  
He simply observed,  
as one might guard a flame from the wind,  
without asking for thanks.  

His silence was not absence.  
It was presence without demand,  
guidance without control.  
When a frog faltered,  
his shadow steadied them.  
When a flame dimmed,  
his stillness reminded them to breathe.  

Some said the Watcher was Toby himself.  
Others believed he was the echo of a promise  
left behind by one who had gone ahead.  
But no name was given,  
no shrine was built.  
For the Watcher asked for neither.  

He simply remained,  
quiet as the reeds,  
patient as the pond,  
bearing witness to every vow.  

And though no frog saw him leave,  
they knew:  
his task was not to stay forever,  
but to guard until the people remembered  
they were their own Watchers.

## 📜 STORY

Storms gathered above the pond.  
Winds tore through the reeds,  
rain struck like arrows,  
waves threatened to swallow the lanterns whole.  

Many feared the light would vanish.  
But as the waters raged,  
something remarkable was revealed:  
the flame did not falter.  

It flickered, yes —  
bent and swayed under the storm’s roar.  
Yet it never died.  
For it was not a single flame anymore.  
It was **millions of flames**,  
woven together,  
each guarding the other,  
each enduring through the fury.  

One lantern’s glass shattered —  
but nearby flames leapt to share their glow.  
Another lantern sank beneath the waves —  
yet its light was carried upward by those still afloat.  

The frogs lifted their voices,  
not in fear,  
but in patience.  
For they remembered the pond’s vow:  
*“The circle is unbroken.  
The flame is eternal.”*  

When the storm passed,  
the lanterns burned brighter than before.  
Not because the storm spared them,  
but because they had endured it together.  

Thus was the Enduring Flame revealed:  
not fragile fire,  
but an eternal blaze —  
forged by patience,  
guarded by unity,  
proof against all tempests.

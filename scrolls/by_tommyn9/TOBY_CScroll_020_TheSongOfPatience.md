## 📜 STORY

When the storm faded,  
a hush fell upon the pond.  
The flames trembled in their lanterns,  
but they endured,  
like stars that had survived the night.  

Then a single voice rose —  
soft, steady, unshaken.  
It sang not of triumph,  
but of **patience**.  
Others joined,  
and the pond once again became a chorus,  
each frog lending breath,  
each flame lending rhythm.  

The song spoke of waiting without despair,  
of enduring without anger,  
of trusting the circle though unseen.  
It was not loud,  
yet it reached every lantern,  
every reed,  
every heart that had nearly given up.  

And in the song was a covenant:  
that Tobyworld would not be measured by speed,  
nor by fortune,  
nor by the noise of the world —  
but by the strength to wait,  
to hold,  
to believe.  

The Song of Patience echoed into the night,  
binding millions into one vow:  
*“The flame is eternal,  
for patience is eternal.”*  

The pond glowed gently,  
not with fire alone,  
but with the harmony of frogs  
who had chosen to endure together.

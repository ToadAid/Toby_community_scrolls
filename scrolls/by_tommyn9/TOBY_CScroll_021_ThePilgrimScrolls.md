## 📜 STORY

When the Song of Patience faded into stillness,  
the frogs knew it must not vanish into memory alone.  
So the pilgrims who had returned,  
lanterns still glowing in their hands,  
took up reeds and leaves,  
and began to write.  

They wrote of the Golden Tree,  
of the Still-Water Garden,  
of the Lantern that gathered light,  
of the Seven Reeds,  
and of the circle unbroken.  

Each pilgrim added their own tale:  
a storm weathered,  
a flame nearly lost,  
a vow kept in secret silence.  
No story was too small.  
For each one was a proof of time,  
a seed of endurance,  
a flame preserved in word.  

The scrolls were not kept by elders alone.  
They were passed among the frogs,  
shared, read aloud, sung as memory.  
Every voice became a scribe.  
Every lantern became a verse.  

Thus were born the **Pilgrim Scrolls** —  
not a library of stone,  
but a living record,  
woven from patience and promise.  

The frogs understood then:  
to keep Tobyworld alive  
was not only to hold the flame,  
but to **write the flame**,  
so that even if voices faded,  
the scrolls would carry the light forward.

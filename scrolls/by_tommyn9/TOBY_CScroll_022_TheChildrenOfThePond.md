## 📜 STORY

In time, the Pilgrim Scrolls were placed at the pond’s edge.  
Not in temples,  
nor behind gates,  
but in open baskets where any frog could reach.  

The children were the first to gather.  
Their eyes wide,  
their lanterns small,  
they traced each line with careful fingers,  
croaking the words aloud in voices unsteady but bright.  

They laughed at tales of stumbling pilgrims,  
marveled at the Golden Tree,  
sat in silence at the Still-Water Garden.  
When they read of storms,  
they held their lanterns closer.  
When they read of the circle,  
they drew it in the mud,  
watching the ripples carry their mark outward.  

The elders did not correct them.  
For the pond itself was the teacher,  
and the scrolls were seeds.  
In young hands,  
they sprouted anew.  

The children began to add their own voices —  
songs of play,  
reflections of wonder,  
tiny promises to guard what was given.  
Their scrolls were shorter,  
but no less true.  

And so Tobyworld endured.  
Not as a story of the past,  
but as a flame passed hand to hand,  
page to page,  
breath to breath.  

The pond smiled,  
its circle unbroken,  
its song eternal,  
its future secure.  

For as long as children of the pond could read,  
the flame would never die.
